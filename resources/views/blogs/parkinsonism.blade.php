             <h2>PARKINSONISM</h2>
             
             <p>parkinsonism is any condition that causes a combination of the movement abnormalities seen in Parkinson s disease —
such as tremor , slow movement, impaired speech or muscle stiffness — especially resulting from the loss of dopamine-
containing nerve cells (neurons).

parkinsonism), including:

         <p> However, these drugs aren't likely to be as effective for some forms of parkinsonism as they are for Parkinson's disease.
Levodopa — which occurs naturally in the body and is always taken as a combination drug — replenishes brain
dopamine, and brain dopamine loss is fundamental to Parkinson's disease. However, in other parkinsonian disorders,
additional brain pathways may be affected.
