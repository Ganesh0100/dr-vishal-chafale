             <h2>HEADACHE</h2>
             
             <p>Headache is one of the most common presenting symptoms of neurological disorders. Whereas the majority of them are innocuous and need only
symptomatic treatment, some can be a sign of serious underlying disorders and
therefore headaches should always be taken seriously. A headache is a pain in
the head radiating above the eyes or the ears, behind the head or in the back of
the upper neck.
</p>
             
             <p>Primary headaches are not associated with any underlying major disease.Examples of primary headaches are tension headaches, migraine and Cluster
headches. Secondary headaches are caused due to some other underlying
disease. These may be minor ones such as uncorrected ophthalmic refractory
error, sinusitis, withdrawal from caffeine and discontinuation of analgesics.
They may also be symptomatic of major illnesses such as brain tumors, strokes,
meningitis, and subarachnoid hemorrhages.

complex migraine. Classical migraine headaches are throbbing in nature, mostly unilateral and often associated with
flashes of light. Aura, nausea and vomiting, photo/phonophobia, scalp tenderness may be present in some of the cases.
In the complicated migraine there are associated neurological signs and symptoms caused by vasoconstriction of
intracranial vessels such as confusion, amnesia, transient monocular blindness, hemiparesis and limb paraesthesias.
Migraine can be precipitated by red wine,menses,hunger ,insomnia,perfumes, etc. A migraine typically lasts from to 72
hours </li>

         <li><span class="bold-blog">  Sentinel headache due to subarachnoid haemorrhage</span>Sentinel headache (SH) is characterized as sudden (thunderclap headache), intense, and persistent headache, preceding
spontaneous subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) by days or weeks. It is often described as the "worst headache of my life"
It is the most common symptom to manifest 10-20 days before rupture of an aneurysm. In addition to headaches,
sentinel leaks may produce nausea, vomiting, photophobia, malaise, or neck pain. These symptoms can easily be
ignored by a physician. Therefore, a high index of suspicion is necessary to diagnose this type of headache due to
subarachnoid haemorrhage.
The possibility of SAH should be suspected if any one or more of these is present along with acute nontraumatic
headache which reaches maximum intensity within one hour, and the patient be referred to a neurophysician and
hospitalized immediately.

         <i class="fa-solid fa-angle-right"></i>
         <li><span class="bold-blog">  Meningitis</span>Acute severe type of headache with neck stiffness and fever suggests meningitis. Meningitis may be mistaken as
migraine sometimes due to the chief symptoms like pounding headache, photophobia, nausea, vomiting, etc. This

         <li><span class="bold-blog"> Tumors</span>profound pounding dull, aching, or throbbing headache of medium intensity which worsens with exertion and change of
position and may be associated with nausea or vomiting may suggest an intracranial tumour. The headaches may
become more frequent, increasing in severity, and not easily relieved. Patient gets disturbed from sleep. They can also be
worsened by coughing or sneezing and persistently occur on the same side often. Vomiting that precedes headache is a
characteristic of posterior fossa tumours. This type of headache should be immediately investigated and brought to the
concern of a neurophysician or neurosurgeon. </li>
         <i class="fa-solid fa-angle-right"></i>
         <li><span class="bold-blog"> Stroke</span>Headache with symptoms such as acute weakness and numbness in the limbs and/or face, nausea, vomiting, an altered

and large ischemic strokes. </li>
         <i class="fa-solid fa-angle-right"></i>
         <li><span class="bold-blog"> Temporal Arteritis</span>It is an inflammatory condition of arteries which involves the extracranial carotid circulation. Temporal arteritis
presents with classical symptoms — headache, jaw claudication, scalp tenderness, and visual disturbances. Fever,
myalgia, anorexia, weight loss, anemia, and malaise may also occur as systemic inflammatory response. Temporal
arteritis usually occurs in older people and is extremely rare in individuals younger than 50 years of age, and present
with visual changes. If not treated, patient may develop partial or complete blindness due to involvement of ophthalmic
artery or its branches. </li>
