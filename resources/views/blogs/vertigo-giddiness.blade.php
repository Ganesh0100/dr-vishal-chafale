             <h2>VERTIGO GIDDINESS</h2>
             
             <p>Giddiness or lightheadedness, a very common symptom seen in practise, is a term used to describe a sensation of altered orientation in space usually described by the patient as “chakar”. Giddiness, lightheadedness, disequilibrium and syncope are often mistaken for one another; most often caused by relative decrease in sensorium and are caused by different conditions.</p>
             <p>Vertigo/ Dizziness is hallucination of movements which results in sensation of external environment spinning and rotating and is mostly caused by an otological disorder and sometimes by CNS disorders. Syncope which is loss of consciousness occurs secondary to inadequate cerebral profusion, a common cause of which is postural hypertension and cardiogenic factors.</p>
