             <h2>Stroke</h2>
             
             <p>A stroke is a "brain attack" .A stroke occurs when the blood supply to part of your brain is interrupted or reduced,
depriving brain tissue of oxygen and nutrients. Within minutes, brain cells begin to die. When brain cells die during a
stroke, abilities controlled by that area of the brain such as memory and muscle control are lost.</p>

<p>How a person is affected by their stroke depends on where the stroke occurs in the brain and how much the brain is
damaged. For example, someone who had a small stroke may only have minor problems such as temporary weakness of
an arm or leg. people who have larger strokes may be permanently paralyzed on one side of their body or lose their
ability to speak. Some people recover completely from strokes, but more than 2/3 of survivors will have some type of
disability.
</p>
             <!--When To See A Doctor ?-->
             <h2>When To See A Doctor ?</h2>
<p>Seek immediate medical attention if you notice any signs or symptoms of a stroke, even if they seem to fluctuate or
disappear. The main symptoms of stroke can be remembered with the word F.A.S.T.
</p>
<div class="list-blog  ul-li-block">
   <h5>Think "FAST" and do the following:</h5>
   
       <ul class="list--items">
        <i class="fa-solid fa-angle-right"></i>
        <li>Face. Ask the person to smile. Does one side of the face droop ?</li>
        <i class="fa-solid fa-angle-right"></i>
        <li>Arms. Ask the person to raise both arms. Does one arm drift downward? Or is one arm unable to rise up ?</li>
        <i class="fa-solid fa-angle-right"></i>
        <li>Speech. Ask the person to repeat a simple phrase. Is his or her speech slurred or strange ?</li>
        <i class="fa-solid fa-angle-right"></i>
        <li> Time. If you observe any of these signs, call ER immediately.</li>
       
        </ul>

        <p>Stroke is a medical emergency. If you see any of the signs of stroke call ER immediately.Don't wait to see if symptoms
stop. Every minute counts. The longer a stroke goes untreated, the greater the potential for brain damage and disability.
</p>

        <p>There are two main types of strokes:lschaemicwhere the blood supply is stopped because of a blood clot, accounting for
85% of all cases

</p>
<h5>Haemorrhagicwhere a weakened blood vessel supplying the brain bursts. Brain hemorrhages can result from many
conditions that affect your blood vessels. These include:
</h5>

<ul class="list--items">
        <i class="fa-solid fa-angle-right"></i>
        <li>Uncontrolled high blood pressure (hvpertension)</li>
         <i class="fa-solid fa-angle-right"></i><li>Overtreatment with anticoagulants (blood thinners)</li>
         <i class="fa-solid fa-angle-right"></i><li>Weak spots in your blood vessel walls (aneurysms)</li>
        
       
        </ul>
        

        <p>A less common cause of hemorrhage is the rupture of an abnormal tangle of thin -walled blood vessels (arteriovenous
malformation).
</p>

<p>There's also a related condition Imow•n as a transient ischaemic attack (TIA), where the blood supply to the brain is
temporarily interrupted.
</p>

<h2>Transient Ischemic Attack (TIA)</h2>

<p>A transient ischemic attack (TIA) — sometimes know-n as a ministroke — is a temporary period of symptoms similar to
those you'd have in a stroke. A temporary decrease in blood supply to part of your brain causes TIAs, which may last as
little as five minutes.
</p>

<p>Like an ischemic stroke, a TIA occurs when a clot or debris blocks blood flowto part of your nervous system — but there
is no permanent tissue damage and no lasting symptoms.
</p>

<p>Seek emergency care even if your symptoms seem to clear up. Having a TIA puts you at greater risk of having a full-
blown stroke, causing permanent damage later. If you've had a TIA, it means there's likely a partially blocked or
narrowed artery leading to your brain or a clot source in the heart.

        <p> Ischemic strokeAbout 80 percent of strokes are ischemic strokes. Ischemic strokes occur when the arteries to your brain
become narrowed or blocked, causing severely reduced blood flow (ischemia).
</p>

<p>Hemorrhagic strokeHemorrhagic stroke occurs when a blood vessel in your brain leaks or ruptures.</p>
<p>Knowing your stroke risk factors, following your doctor's recommendations and adopting a healthy lifestyle are the best
steps you can take to prevent a stroke. If you've had a stroke or a transient ischemic attack (TIA), these measures might
help prevent another stroke. The follow-up care you receive in the hospital and afterward also may play a role as well.
