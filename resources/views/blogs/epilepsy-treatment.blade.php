             <h2>EPILEPSY</h2>
             
             <p>Epilepsy is a disease of the central nervous system (CNS) that can cause excess
electrical activity in the brain. The brain contains billions of neurons (nerve
cells) that create and receive electrical impulses. Electrical impulses allow
neurons to communicate with one another. During a seizure, there is abnormal
and excessive electrical activity in the brain. This can cause changes in
awareness, behavior , and/or abnormal movements. This activity usually lasts
only a few seconds to minutes.

            <h2>Types</h2>
           <div class="list-blog  ul-li-block">
   
       <ul class="list--items">
        <i class="fa-solid fa-angle-right"></i>
        <li>One of the most common seizure types is a convulsion. This may be called a
"tonic clonic" or "grand mal" seizure. In this type of seizure, a person may
stiffen and have jerking muscle movements; during the muscle-jerking, the
person may bite their tongue, causing bleeding or frothing at the mouth.</li>
         <i class="fa-solid fa-angle-right"></i><li>Other seizure types are less dramatic. Shaking movements may be isolated to
one arm or part of the face. Alternatively, the person may suddenly stop
responding and stare for a few seconds, sometimes with chewing motions or
smacking the lips.</li>
         <i class="fa-solid fa-angle-right"></i><li>Seizures may also cause "sensations"
that only the patient feels. As an
example , one type of seizure can cause
stomach discomfort, fear, or an
unpleasant smell. Such subjective
feelings are commonly referred to as
auras. A person usually experiences the
same symptoms with each seizure aura.
Sometimes, a seizure aura can occur
before a convulsive seizure.</li>
         <i class="fa-solid fa-angle-right"></i><li>A single seizure does not necessarily
indicate epilepsy. Seizures requires
some tests like EEG , MRI for evaluation
and treatment planning. An
electroencephalogram (EEG) monitors
the electrical activity of your brain. It
takes less than 30 minutes and indicates
the activity in the brain at that
particular time. Sometimes prologed
monitoring may be required. A
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
scan can show up any areas of damage
to the brain that could be causing the epilepsy.</li>

<h2>Treatment</h2>
 <div class="list-blog-set ul-li-block">
<ul class="list--items">
      
         <i class="fa-solid fa-angle-right"></i>
         <li>Drug therapy can control seizures completely in up to 80% of people. It may be necessary to take the medication(s) for a
number of years, but treatment can often be stopped when you have been free from seizures for three or more years.
Treatment must not be stopped suddenly as this can trigger a seizure. For a few people, drug treatment is not able to
control their epilepsy completely, but is still beneficial in preventing some seizures. Neurosurgew may be a possibility
for those people whose epilepsy is caused by an abnormality in one particular area of the brainand no response to
medi cal management.
</li>
         <i class="fa-solid fa-angle-right"></i>
         <li>The dosages of drugs given need to be adjusted to individual patients in order to avoid unwanted side effects such as
drowsiness. The ideal dosage is the lowest dose necessary to stop the seizures occurring. Regular check-ups are
necessary in people taking long- term drug therapy.
